## Usage
TODO: Finish this. Link to GitHub pages.

## Contributing

### Requirements

- [Node.js >= 12.0.0](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) - Probably better that you install by running `npm i -g yarn`

### Running

Run `yarn start` in the root of the project.

### Commits

Code quality and code formatting are taken very seriously. Prettier is used to format all the code in the project before each commit and I highly suggest you configure your editor to auto format on save. The `.vscode` folder contains some general settings that _should_ do this for you if you're running VS Code. The project is also configured to use Conventional Commits and Commit Lint to format all commit messages.

- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) format used in this project:
    - Format: `[type]: [message]`
    - The `type` should be lowercase and should be one of `fix`, `feat`, `docs`, `style`, `perf`, `test`, or `chore`
    - The `message` should be in sentence case which means the first character should be uppercase. (e.x. `Did some work`)
    - Full example: `chore: Updated README with more details about the project`

Happy Streaming!
